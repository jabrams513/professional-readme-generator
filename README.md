Tests, and Questions

WHEN I enter my project title

THEN this is displayed as the title of the README

WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions

THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
